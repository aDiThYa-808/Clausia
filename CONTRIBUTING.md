# Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project.

This repository is open source under the Apache 2.0 License, which means you are free to use, fork, and modify the code for your own purposes. However, contributions to this repository are maintained in a curated manner.

## What You Can Contribute Without Permission

No setup or API keys are required for the above.

## Code Contributions

This project integrates with third-party APIs and uses secret keys that are not included in the repository for security and cost reasons. Because of this, pull requests that involve application logic or backend behavior cannot be properly tested without coordination.

### As a result:

- Direct code PRs without prior discussion are not accepted
- All code contributions must be discussed and approved first

---

## How to Contribute Code

### If you’d like to work on the code:

- Open an issue describing what you want to build or change
- Wait for maintainer approval and guidance
- After alignment, submit a pull request referencing the issue
- If necessary, further instructions or limited access will be provided during the discussion.
