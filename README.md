# Clausia 

**Generate professional privacy policies for your apps and games in minutes, not hours.**

Clausia is a smart privacy policy generator designed specifically for Indian indie app and game developers. Born from the frustration of manually creating privacy policies for Play Store submissions, Clausia turns a tedious legal process into a simple questionnaire.

## 🎯 Why Clausia?

As an indie developer, you've probably been there:
- ⏰ **Hours wasted** cobbling together privacy policies from templates
- 🤔 **Legal confusion** about what clauses you actually need
- 🔄 **Constant back-and-forth** between ChatGPT for text and Google Sites for formatting
- 😰 **Play Store rejections** due to incomplete or invalid privacy policies

**Clausia solves this.** Answer a few simple questions about your app, and get a legally compliant privacy policy with a live link ready for your Play Store submission.

## 💭 The Story Behind Clausia

This project was born from personal frustration. Like many indie developers, I hit the privacy policy wall when releasing my games on the Play Store. Hours were spent switching between ChatGPT for content and Google Sites for the live link, only to wonder if the result was actually compliant.

There had to be a better way. Clausia is that better way.
